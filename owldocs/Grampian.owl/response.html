<body><h2>Response</h2><table><tr><td>evidence: S93, S02, H1

Question: Better rename to Strategy or Action?
Question: Divide into long-term and short-term?

S93 lists the following responses to a substantial fall in farming income:
-- drop farming altogether (mainly Disengager)
-- work harder on the farm (mainly Accumulator)
-- increase or begin outside gainful activities (on-farm or off-farm) (mainly Accumulator)
-- continue as before with lower living standard (mainly Conservative)

other responses (S93): 
-- work longer hours (included in work harder on farm above)
-- intensify production

S02 adds these:
-- expand farm
-- apply for (different kind of) policy measure (productivist, post-productivist)

H1 adds these:
-- switching farm system (from arable to livestock and vice versa)
-- diversify and supply local market
-- obtain subsidy for marginal crops
-- forced responses (due to restrictions from events like BSE): 
         keep livestock longer than planned, 
         not able to buy replacements when planned
         positive: be able to buy more cattle than planned because of significant price drops</td></tr></table><h3></h3><table><tr><td>&#8225;owl:Thing</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8225;<a href="grampiancasestudything.html" target="content">GrampianCaseStudyThing</a></td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8225;<b><a href="response.html" target="content">Response</a></b></td></tr></table>
